## Identify Data Formats

### Overview
Data is a collection of facts used to record information, often organized in structures representing entities important to an organization (e.g., customers, products). Entities have attributes (e.g., name, address).

### Data Classifications
Data can be classified as:
- **Structured**
- **Semi-structured**
- **Unstructured**

#### Structured Data
- Adheres to a fixed schema.
- Commonly tabular (rows and columns).
- Stored in databases using a relational model.

**Example: Customer and Product tables**

#### Semi-structured Data
- Has some structure with variations between instances.
- Common format: JSON.

**Example:**
- Customer documents with varying address and contact information.

*Note: JSON is just one of many semi-structured data representations.*

#### Unstructured Data
- No specific structure.
- Includes documents, images, audio, video, and binary files.

  - **Nested Data Structures:** Optimized for complex nested data structures, making it suitable for big data processing frameworks like Apache Spark and Hadoop.
  - **Data Encoding:** Utilizes different encoding techniques for different data types to enhance storage efficiency.

## Explore Databases

### Overview
A database is a central system used to store and query data records. Unlike file systems, databases are dedicated to managing data records efficiently.

### Relational Databases
- **Usage:** Store and query structured data.
- **Structure:** Data is stored in tables representing entities (e.g., customers, products, sales orders).
- **Primary Keys:** Unique identifiers for each entity instance, used to reference entities in other tables.
- **Normalization:** Elimination of duplicate data values, ensuring data is stored only once.
- **Query Language:** Managed and queried using Structured Query Language (SQL), based on ANSI standard.

**Example:** A customer's primary key referenced in a sales order to indicate which customer placed the order.

#### Key Features
- **Tables:** Represent entities.
- **Primary Keys:** Unique identifiers.
- **Normalization:** Reduces duplicate data.
- **SQL:** Standard query language.

### Non-relational Databases
Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, do not use a relational schema. They are categorized into four common types:

#### Key-value Databases
- **Structure:** Each record consists of a unique key and an associated value.
- **Flexibility:** Value can be in any format.

**Example:** Key-value pairs where the value could be text, JSON, or any other format.

#### Document Databases
- **Structure:** A form of key-value database where the value is a JSON document.
- **Optimization:** Optimized for parsing and querying JSON documents.

**Example:** Storing customer information as JSON documents.

#### Column Family Databases
- **Structure:** Store tabular data with rows and columns.
- **Column Families:** Columns are grouped into families that are logically related.

**Example:** A database storing user profiles, with column families for personal info and activity logs.

#### Graph Databases
- **Structure:** Store entities as nodes with links (edges) defining relationships between them.
- **Usage:** Ideal for complex relationships and interconnected data.

**Example:** A social network database where users are nodes and friendships are edges.

## Explore Transactional Data Processing

### Overview
A transactional data processing system records transactions, which are discrete units of work encapsulating specific events an organization wants to track. Transactions can be financial, retail, or other types of business activities.

### Characteristics of Transactional Systems
- **High Volume:** Often handle millions of transactions per day.
- **Speed:** Data must be quickly accessible.
- **Transactional Processing:** Known as Online Transactional Processing (OLTP).

### OLTP Solutions
OLTP solutions use a database system optimized for both read and write operations to support transactional workloads involving CRUD operations (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete). These operations must ensure data integrity through ACID semantics:

#### ACID Semantics
- **Atomicity:** Each transaction is a single unit that either fully succeeds or fully fails.
  - Example: A funds transfer transaction must debit one account and credit another completely or not at all.
- **Consistency:** Transactions take the database from one valid state to another.
  - Example: A completed funds transfer must accurately reflect in both accounts involved.
- **Isolation:** Concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other.
  - Example: While a funds transfer is in process, other transactions must return consistent account balances.
- **Durability:** Committed transactions are permanently recorded.
  - Example: Once a funds transfer is committed, it remains recorded even if the system is turned off.

### Usage of OLTP Systems
OLTP systems support live applications that process business data, often referred to as line of business (LOB) applications.

## Explore Analytical Data Processing

### Overview
Analytical data processing uses read-only (or read-mostly) systems to store vast volumes of historical data or business metrics. Analytics can be based on snapshots of data at given points in time or a series of snapshots.

### Common Architecture for Enterprise-Scale Analytics
1. **ETL Process:** Operational data is extracted, transformed, and loaded into a data lake for analysis.
2. **Data Loading:** Data is loaded into a schema of tables, typically in a Spark-based data lakehouse or a data warehouse.
3. **Aggregation:** Data in the data warehouse is aggregated and loaded into an OLAP model or cube. Measures from fact tables are calculated for intersections of dimensions from dimension tables.
4. **Querying:** The data in the data lake, data warehouse, and analytical model can be queried to produce reports, visualizations, and dashboards.

### Key Components

#### Data Lakes
- **Usage:** Collect and analyze large volumes of file-based data.
- **Scalability:** Flexible and scalable storage for large-scale data.

## Understand Relational Data

### Overview
In a relational database, collections of entities from the real world are modeled as tables. An entity can be anything for which you want to record information, typically important objects and events.

### Key Concepts

#### Entities and Tables
- **Entities:** Represent real-world objects or events (e.g., customers, products, orders).
- **Tables:** Model collections of entities. Each table contains rows, with each row representing a single instance of an entity.

**Example:**
- **Customer Table:** Each row contains data for a single customer.
- **Product Table:** Each row defines a single product.
- **Order Table:** Each row represents an order made by a customer.
- **Line Item Table:** Each row represents a product included in an order.

#### Columns and Data Types
- **Columns:** Define attributes of the entity. Each row in a table has the same columns, though not all columns need to have a value (can be NULL).
- **Data Types:** Each column stores data of a specific datatype.

**Common Data Types:**
- **Text Data:** Character-based (fixed or variable length) for columns like `Email`.
- **Numeric Data:** Decimal or integer values for columns like `Price` or `Quantity`.
- **Date/Time Data:** Date and time values for columns like `OrderDate`.

#### Standard Datatypes
- Most database systems support standard datatypes defined by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI).

### Example Scenario
In a retail system:
- **Customer Table:** Contains customer details such as `FirstName`, `LastName`, `Email`, `MiddleName`.
- **Product Table:** Contains product details such as `ProductID`, `ProductName`, `Price`.
- **Order Table:** Contains order details such as `OrderID`, `CustomerID`, `OrderDate`.
- **Line Item Table:** Contains line items within an order such as `OrderID`, `ProductID`, `Quantity`.

## Understand Normalization

### Overview
Normalization is a schema design process that minimizes data duplication and enforces data integrity in a database.

### Core Principles of Normalization
1. **Separate each entity into its own table.**
2. **Separate each discrete attribute into its own column.**
3. **Uniquely identify each entity instance (row) using a primary key.**
4. **Use foreign key columns to link related entities.**

### Example Scenario

#### Un-normalized Data
- **Issues:** 
  - Data duplication.
  - Combined customer and product details in the same cells.

#### Normalized Data
- **Changes:**
  - Each entity (e.g., customer, product, sales order, line item) is stored in its own table.
  - Each attribute is in its own column.
  - Primary keys uniquely identify rows.
  - Foreign keys link related entities.

#### Benefits of Normalization
- **Reduces Duplication:** Modifying a customer's address requires changing a single row.
- **Ensures Data Integrity:** Values are constrained to appropriate data types.
- **Granularity:** Allows detailed querying (e.g., filtering customers by city).
- **Referential Integrity:** RDBMS enforces that foreign key values exist in the related table (e.g., no orders for non-existent customers).

#### Composite Keys
- **Usage:** Unique combination of multiple columns to identify rows.
- **Example:** LineItem table uses a combination of `OrderNo` and `ItemNo` to identify a line item in an order.

## Explore SQL

### Overview
SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to communicate with relational databases, allowing for tasks such as updating and retrieving data. Common relational database systems using SQL include Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, and Oracle.

### History

- **pgSQL:** Used by PostgreSQL.
- **PL/SQL:** Used by Oracle.

## Describe Database Objects

### Overview
In addition to tables, a relational database contains other structures to optimize data organization, encapsulate programmatic actions, and improve access speed. Three key structures are views, stored procedures, and indexes.

### Views
- **Definition:** A virtual table based on the results of a SELECT query.
- **Usage:** Provides a simplified view of data from one or more tables, making it easier to work with complex queries.
- **Example:** A view combining order and customer data for easy retrieval of delivery addresses.

### Stored Procedures
- **Definition:** Encapsulated SQL statements that can be executed on command.
- **Usage:** Encapsulates programmatic logic for actions that applications need to perform on data.
- **Flexibility:** Can be defined with parameters to perform actions based on specific criteria.
- **Example:** A stored procedure to change a product name based on product ID.

### Indexes
- **Definition:** Helps search for data in a table efficiently.
- **Usage:** Similar to a book index, it creates a sorted set of references with pointers to the corresponding rows.
- **Efficiency:** Dramatically improves query performance, especially in large tables.
- **Considerations:** 
  - Indexes consume storage space.
  - Maintenance of indexes can slow down insert, update, and delete operations.
  - Balance the number of indexes to optimize query speed versus operation performance.

### Summary
